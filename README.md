# Star Pattern Collection⭐

## Star Pattern 
Welcome to the Star Pattern repository! This repository contains various star patterns implemented in c++ programming languages. These patterns are commonly used in coding practice and interviews to demonstrate understanding of loops and basic programming constructs.

In this series of Star pattern...here we'll upload a full series of star pattern through which your loop statement will very clear, we try to cover all type of patterns asked in interviews.

This repository contains various star pattern programs implemented in c++ programming languages. The goal is to help beginners understand how to create and manipulate star patterns using loops and conditional statements.

### Some of the following patterns included:

1. Half Pyramid
#### Pattern:
  ```
    *
    * *
    * * *
    * * * *
    * * * * *
  ```

2. Full Pyramid
  #### Pattern:
    
           *
          ***
         *****
        *******
       *********

3. Inverted Pyramid
#### Pattern:
```
    *********
     *******
      *****
       ***
        *
```

4. Diamond Shape
#### Pattern:
```
        *
       ***
      *****
     *******
    *********
     *******
      *****
       ***
        *
```

5. Right Angle Triangle
#### Pattern:
   ```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
   ```
6. Left Angle Triangle
#### Pattern:
```
        *
      * *
    * * * 
  * * * *
* * * * *
```

## How to Use

Each pattern is implemented in separate files. You can run them using the respective language's interpreter or compiler.

# Example Half Pyramid
code:
int main()
{
    for(int i=1;i<=5;i++)
    {
        for(int j=1;j<=5;j++)
        {
            if(j<=i)
            {
                cout<<"*";
            }
            else
            {
                cout<<" ";
            }
        }
        cout<<endl;
        
    }
    
}

### output:
<div>⭐</div>
<div>⭐⭐</div>
<div>⭐⭐⭐</div>
<div>⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>
<div>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</div>
